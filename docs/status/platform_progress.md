## üéØ Recommendation

Based on current usage (paper, live, backtesting all active), I recommend:

**Primary Focus: Option A - Advanced Order Types & Risk Management**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Safety First:** Users trading live money need better risk controls
2. **Immediate Value:** Bracket orders and trailing stops are universally useful
3. **Fills Gaps:** Current implementation has basic MARKET/LIMIT orders only
4. **Quick Wins:** Can deliver high-value features incrementally

**Secondary Focus: Option B - Performance Analytics**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Complements Monitoring:** Natural extension of Phase 1.5 work
2. **User Feedback:** Helps users evaluate and improve strategies
3. **Low Risk:** Doesn't touch execution logic, purely analytical

**Suggested Sequence:**
1. **Phase 2.1:** Bracket orders + trailing stops (1 session)
2. **Phase 2.2:** Enhanced risk management (1 session)
3. **Phase 2.3:** Performance metrics (1 session)
4. **Phase 2.4:** Report generation (1 session)

## üìä Known Gaps & Technical Debt

### High Priority
- No tests for dashboard.py (added after test suite)
- Order book implementation is skeleton only (no L2 data processing)
- Mock market data generates random walks (unrealistic for testing)

### Medium Priority
- Portfolio snapshot not version-controlled (breaking changes possible)
- Event bus has no error handling for subscriber crashes
- No commission modeling in backtest engine

### Low Priority
- Telemetry logs grow unbounded (rotation exists, cleanup doesn't)
- Strategy hot-reload not supported (must restart process)
- No Web UI (terminal-only interface)

---

## üîß Maintenance Needs

### Documentation
- ‚úÖ All major features documented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need video tutorials/walkthroughs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è API reference documentation (auto-generated from docstrings)

### Testing
- ‚úÖ 90 tests, good coverage of core functionality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dashboard tests missing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Order book tests missing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è End-to-end integration tests needed

### Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Linting and type checking enforced
- ‚úÖ Git hooks configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CI/CD pipeline not configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Automated release process missing

---

## üí° User Feedback Integration

**Current User Patterns:**
- Using all three modes (paper, live, backtest)
- Proactive about addressing issues before reports
- Values concise, clear documentation highly
- Prioritizes monitoring/observability features

**Recommendations Based on Usage:**
1. Continue safety-first approach
2. Add more real-time visibility (aligns with dashboard success)
3. Focus on practical trading features over infrastructure
4. Maintain high documentation standards

---

## üìù Next Steps

**To Decide:**
1. Which Phase 2 option should we pursue?
2. Should we address any high-priority technical debt first?
3. Do we need additional documentation before new features?

**To Consider:**
- Are there any missing features preventing production usage?
- What user pain points have emerged from current usage?
- Should we focus on depth (enhancing existing features) or breadth (new capabilities)?
